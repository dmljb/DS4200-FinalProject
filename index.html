    <h1>Analysis of 311 Service Requests Around Northeastern University</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">A Semester-Based Exploration of Campus-Area Activity</p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This project will aim to examine how 311 service requests in the
        surrounding neighborhoods around Northeastern University change
        based on the current semester. Our main goal will be to understand
        which complaint types fluctuate over time, which of the areas analyzed
        experience the highest levels of activity, and how seasonal shifts
        in campus population affect the city service demand.
    </p>
    <p>
        We used a combination of Python (Altair) as well as D3.js visualizations
        to analyze trends in time, space, and complaint type.
