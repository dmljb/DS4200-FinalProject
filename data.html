  <h1>Dataset Description</h1>

  <p>
    Our dataset is from the official Boston 311 Service Requests, which is
    hosted on <a href="https://data.boston.gov">data.boston.gov</a>. It contains
    all of the non-emergency reports that have been filed since 2011, this includes
    potholes, trash collection issues, parking violations, noise complaints, public
    safety issues and much more.
  </p>

  <p>
    After filtering the data to the surrounding neighborhoods of Northeastern
    University, we created some semester labels and managed to retain a large
    amount of observations and features which include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Complaint Type (categorical)</li>
    <li>Location (continuous coordinates)</li>
    <li>Department</li>
    <li>Neighborhood</li>
    <li>Season / Semester</li>
    <li>Timestamps (year, month, weekday, hour)</li>
    <li>Response Time (continuous)</li>
  </ul>
