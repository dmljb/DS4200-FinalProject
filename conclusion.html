  <h1>Project Conclusions</h1>
  
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Our analysis of 311 service requests around Northeastern University reveals that student presence significantly impacts neighborhood service demand. The data shows clear patterns tied to the academic calendar, with complaint volumes spiking during semester transitions and dropping during summer months when students are away.
  </p>

  <h2>Parking Dominates Campus Area Complaints</h2>
  <p>
    Parking enforcement accounts for over 63,000 requests—more than triple any other complaint type. This overwhelming dominance reflects the fundamental challenge of limited parking resources in NEU's dense urban environment. The constant tension over parking affects students, residents, and businesses alike, making it the primary service demand around campus.
  </p>

  <h2>Student Arrival Creates Dramatic Spikes</h2>
  <p>
    The data validates our core hypothesis: student presence directly affects complaint patterns. Late August and early September show a 50% increase in daily requests, jumping from the typical 600-1,000 range to nearly 1,500 requests during the fall move-in period. This spike demonstrates that the return of approximately 20,000 students creates measurable stress on neighborhood infrastructure and services.
  </p>

  <h2>Geographic Concentration Around Campus</h2>
  <p>
    Complaints concentrate heavily within 1-2 km of NEU campus, with the Roxbury/South End corridor bearing the highest burden. Mission Hill shows significant complaint density aligned with off-campus student housing, while Back Bay and Downtown areas reflect mixed student and resident activity. These geographic patterns clearly identify which neighborhoods experience the most impact from campus-adjacent urban pressures.
  </p>

  <h2>Sanitation Remains a Persistent Challenge</h2>
  <p>
    Street cleaning and improper trash storage rank as the second and third most common complaint types, with approximately 20,000 requests each. The high volume of sanitation complaints reveals that waste management infrastructure struggles to keep pace with the demands of dense urban living combined with a large student population. This suggests that current trash collection schedules and resources may need adjustment during peak academic periods.
  </p>

  <h2>Response Times Vary by Issue Type</h2>
  <p>
    The city prioritizes different complaint types based on urgency. Public health concerns like needle pickup are resolved quickly, typically within 10 days. Infrastructure repairs such as pothole and sidewalk maintenance take 10-30 days with significant variability. Parking violations show the widest spread, with some cases extending beyond 180 days, likely due to unpaid or contested tickets rather than delayed city response.
  </p>

  <h2>Dual Patterns: Academic Calendar and Weather</h2>
  <p>
    Our analysis reveals two overlapping patterns influencing 311 requests. First, the academic calendar creates predictable spikes during semester transitions (late August, early September, and late May). Second, seasonal weather introduces additional variation: during warm months (May-September), neighborhoods with parks like Jamaica Plain see increased complaints related to outdoor activities, trash accumulation, and noise. During cold months (November-March), these park-adjacent areas show fewer complaints as harsh weather limits outdoor gatherings, shifting service demand back to the high-density residential core.
  </p>

  <h2>Weekly Activity Rhythms</h2>
  <p>
    Consistent weekend dips in complaint volume throughout the year show that requests are driven by weekday urban activity. This pattern reflects the regular rhythms of campus life, commuting, business operations, and daily activities rather than random issues. The predictable weekly cycle suggests that complaints are fundamentally tied to when people are most active in the neighborhood.
  </p>

  <h2>Summer Reveals the Urban Baseline</h2>
  <p>
    June through August shows notably reduced complaint volumes, revealing what the neighborhood looks like without the student population. This summer baseline demonstrates that students act as a "multiplier effect" on existing urban challenges rather than creating entirely unique problems. The comparison between summer and academic year volumes proves the magnitude of student impact on local services.
  </p>

  <h2>Implications for City Planning and University Operations</h2>
  <p>
    These findings have practical applications for both the city and NEU. The city should surge resources for parking enforcement, trash collection, and street cleaning during late August/early September and again in late May. Trash collection schedules should align with the academic calendar to handle increased waste during move-in and move-out periods. For NEU, the data suggests the need for better coordination with city services during high-impact periods and enhanced community relations efforts focused on Roxbury, Mission Hill, and South End neighborhoods where student presence creates the most strain.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
  <p>
    NEU doesn't exist in isolation—it's embedded in an urban ecosystem where the university acts as an amplifier of existing neighborhood challenges. While parking and sanitation issues persist year-round, student arrivals intensify these problems significantly. Effective management requires coordinated planning between the city and university, with resource allocation strategies accounting for both predictable academic calendar cycles and seasonal weather patterns.
  </p>

  <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
  <p>
    Our analysis could be strengthened by incorporating multiple years of data to confirm whether patterns hold consistently across different academic years. More detailed geospatial filtering could help identify specific street-level hotspots within neighborhoods. Additionally, building predictive models based on these seasonal patterns could help the city and university proactively allocate resources before demand spikes occur. Comparing spring semester returns (January) more systematically with fall semester data would further validate the student impact hypothesis.
