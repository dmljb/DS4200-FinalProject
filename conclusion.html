  <h1>Project Conclusions</h1>

  <p>
    This section will explain what our major findings were from the visualizations,
    such as seasonal trends, location-based patterns, and response time insights.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our future improvements can include incorporating additional years of data, more
    detailed geospatial filtering, or building models that can predict based on seasonal
    patterns.
