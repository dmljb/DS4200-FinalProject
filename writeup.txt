Visualization 1 (Bar Chart)
We designed a horizontal bar chart with a primarily blue gradient to display 
the most prominent complaint types around Northeastern University. The horizontal 
orientation helps to accommodate long category names without any rotation, while 
sorting from highest to lowest immediately reveals that Parking Enforcement clearly 
has the highest volume, with over 63,000 requests. This design makes it instantly clear 
that parking and sanitation issues are the primary civic concerns in the campus area.

Visualization 2 (Line Chart)
This time series line chart tracks daily complaint volumes throughout 2024 by using 
a green line to differentiate it from other visualizations. We chose daily granularity 
because we felt it would reveal both weekly patterns and seasonal trends well. Interactive 
tooltips provide exact dates and counts for more detailed exploration. This design 
successfully highlights how complaint volumes correlate with the academic calendar, 
increasing dramatically when students return back in the Fall and dropping during 
Thanksgiving and the holidays.

Visualization 3: (Box Plot)
This box plot visualization compares response times across the top 10 complaint 
types using horizontal boxes and outlier points in orange. We chose a box plot because 
it efficiently shows the mean, quartiles, and outliers for each category, revealing both 
typical response times and outliers/exceptional cases. The orange color differentiates this
from other visualizations while still remaining visible against the white background.
The horizontal orientation allows for easy comparison across categories and accommodates 
category labels. This design shows significant variation in response times, where 
some issues like Needle Pickup and CE Collection are resolved within days, while others 
like Sign Repair and Sidewalk Repair show wide distributions with many outliers extending 
beyond 100 days, which indicates systemic delays.

Visualization 4:
To create our interactive neighborhood heatmap, we chose to use a scatter plot map 
with specific neighborhood zones. This allowed the data to highlight the spatial 
distribution of the data and help us understand the geographic impact of the university 
campus activity levels. The visualization contains a couple key design elements, 
such as data points color coded by category, and interactive filters to organize
data and isolate specific patterns. The visualization also had tooltips that provided 
a detailed examination of individual 311 cases to the user.


Visualization 5: 
We chose an animated scatter plot with an interactive slider to sift through 
different months of data. This was key as it allowed for understanding of how the issues 
noted by 311 service calls change throughout the year, based on variables such as 
university activity levels, which are usually high during an active semester. This 
visualization also included neighborhood zones to show where activity is prominent, 
along with a bar chart that shows the monthly volume of calls at a glance. This 
visualization answered the question of “When” complaints occur and highlighted how 
patterns change throughout the year. Thanks to this visualization, it was made clear 
that complaints surged during the beginning and end of the Northeastern academic semesters.
